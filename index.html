      <h5 class="text-success" text-capitalize>Established in 2013</h5>
      <p class="text-muted">All Saints College together with the help of Parry and Rosenthal Architects developed an Architectural Master Plan promoting redevelopment throughout the college to ensure it is well placed to meet the evolving demands of the future. In 2010, Perkins Builders were commissioned by All Saints College to begin construction of a new state-of-the-art Performing Arts Theatre, situated at the front of the College along Ewing Avenue.

        The new Performing Arts Theatre included an auditorium with a seating capacity of 420 people, four new general learning areas, new staff office facilities, a complete theatre management system with extensive above auditorium catwalks and back of house facilities for all stage performances.  Construction methods include a structural steel frame with full height acoustic brickwork throughout, complete with external stone cladding.  To the southern elevation there is full height external glazing together with steel columns encased with glulam timber beams.  Within the building there is high specification for the internal finishes with a significant emphasis on the internal timber wall panelling throughout interfaced with timber joinery.
        
        Challenges of the project included working around an operating college and chapel, site access limitations, a complex structural and architectural design, as well as a completely automated state-of-the-art integrated building and theatre management system. The end product is a multi-purpose theatre/learning building which far exceeds the bench mark for an educational theatre facility.</p>

  <hr>
  <h5 class="text-success" text-capitalize>Established in 1981</h5>
  <p class="text-muted">All Saints parish is a community of people who celebrate Jesus Christ as Lord. We are committed to both growing in our faith and sharing our faith with all God’s people in the wider Bull Creek - Leeming area.

    We will do this by finding creative ways to engage in community activities that allow people to discover the Risen Christ amongst his people through acts of mercy, love and justice.
    
    With Christ as our teacher, we aspire to be an invitational community where visitors find a genuine welcome and hospitality. Worship is at the heart of our life, and through meeting regularly for prayer and fellowship we encourage our people to become involved in the many aspects of the community whereby they can exercise their God-given gifts and talents to create a compassionate and caring community.
    
    There are many ways people can become involved in God’s work at All Saints’ through participating in our worship liturgy, helping with weekly emergency hampers, assisting on our fellowship group, teaching in the children’s Ministry team, or by joining one of the study/prayer groups at the church.
    
    Our services incorporate celebration of the Eucharist (Holy Communion) and any who wish to receive communion are encouraged to do so, including our children. Fellowship over a morning tea or coffee occurs between our two Sunday services.
    
    All Saints' College Chapel is a place of worship in the parish of Bull Creek-Leeming.</p>
